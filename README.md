# Client-server-TCP-UDP-app

Implementing a platform which uses the following:

1) A server, which connects the clients to the platform
2)  TCP clients. A TCP client connects to the server and can receive from the user commands such as subscribe/unsubscribe to certain topics. It prints out the messages received from the server.
3)  UDP clients. 

The platform also prints out when a client is connected on a certain IP and port, when he disconnects and can communicate using different data formats. For each message from a topic from the server, all clients will print out the message received.
